Are you one of the people who are bugged by nonsense that is going on in indian media lately? Then there is so much negativity on the web about it, which is not good for your health, because let's face it, we are fun loving poeople. So go ahead and install this thing from [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modi-fy/hgpkeghcjamhfjmnijkfoffjopncjocl/null). 


Better yet, you have a phrase which you think it will be hilarious if replaced with something else or you want to modify a phrase that is already exists on the extension then fork this, add your word to wordlist.js file(or just create an [issue](https://github.com/manV/MODI-fy/issues/new) on the repo) and within hours it will be on your installed chrome extension!
